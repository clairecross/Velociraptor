### Velociraptor publication available through bioRxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.01.591375v1

The Velociraptor workflow includes two novel cell identification tools: Velociraptor-Claw (VR-Claw) and Velociraptor-Eye (VR-Eye).

VR-Claw reveals condition-specific cell populations (e.g., cells associated with overall survival).

VR-Eye seeks cells based on a user-defined phenotype. With VR-Eye, cell identity can be defined based on phenotypic comparisons with well-established cell identities to assess if a population strongly matches a single cell type or if it has similarity with multiple populations. VR-Eye also enables automated cross-platform cell identification.

Velociraptor Overview. VR-Claw utilizes local phenotypic cell neighborhoods to identify clinically relevant cell populations. The upper right panel in the red box highlights cells associated with shorter (red) or longer (blue) survival times. Marker Enrichment Modeling (MEM) quantifies the phenotype of a population of interest, and that MEM label is used to seek similar cells in new samples with VR-Eye. VR-Eye quantifies and plots similarity to a specified phenotype of interest (i.e., with a MEM label) with purple indicating low similarity and red indicating high similarity. 

Velociraptor was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Irish at Vanderbilt University.  The research was supported by the following funding resources: NIH/NCI grants R01 NS096238 (RAI, JMI), R01 CA226833 (JMI, CEC, SM, MJH), R01 NS118580 (RAI), U01 AI125056 (JMI), U54 CA217450 (JMI, MJH), T32GM137793 (CEC), the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC, P30 CA68485), the Michael David Greene Brain Cancer Fund (RAI, JMI), the Southeastern Brain Tumor Foundation (RAI, JMI), a gift from Daniel F Hewins (RAI), the Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation (RAI, JMI), and by the Human Immunology Discovery Initiative of the Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology.
