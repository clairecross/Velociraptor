The Velociraptor workflow includes two novel cell identification tools: Velociraptor-Claw (VR-Claw) and Velociraptor-Eye (VR-Eye).

VR-Claw reveals condition-specific cell populations (e.g., cells associated with overall survival).

VR-Eye seeks cells based on a user-defined phenotype. With VR-Eye, cell identity can be defined based on phenotypic comparisons with well-established cell identities to assess if a population strongly matches a single cell type or if it has similarity with multiple populations. VR-Eye also enables automated cross-platform cell identification.

Velociraptor Overview. VR-Claw utilizes local phenotypic cell neighborhoods to identify clinically relevant cell populations. The upper right panel in the red box highlights cells associated with shorter (red) or longer (blue) survival times. Marker Enrichment Modeling (MEM) can be used to automatically quantify population phenotypes, and MEM labels can then be used as input to VR-Eye. VR-Eye quantifies and plots similarity to a specified phenotype of interest (i.e., with a MEM label) with purple indicating low similarity and red indicating high similarity.
